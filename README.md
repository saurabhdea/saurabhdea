> I build AI systems that understand **context, emotion, and intent** —  
> not just prompts and commands.

My focus is on tools where AI becomes a *quiet bridge* between humans, software, and workflows.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Build

### 🧠 Emotion-Aware Interfaces
AI that adapts to *how* a user feels, not just *what* they say.

- Calm, low-noise conversational UX  
- Emotion as signal, not decoration  
- Support without dependency  

---

### 🤖 AI Agents & Automation
Practical AI that does real work.

- Task-specific personal agents  
- Tool-connecting automation  
- Context-aware decision systems  

---

### 🧰 Developer & CLI Tools
I love tools that feel fast, honest, and invisible.

- Self-healing systems  
- AI-assisted debugging  
- Automation-first workflows  
- Minimal interfaces with maximum leverage  

---

## 🧪 Experiments & Interests

- Loneliness-aware AI companions  
- Self-repairing backends  
- AI memory & long-term context  
- Human-centered system design  
- Minimal UX for complex intelligence  

---

## 🧠 How I Think

- AI should **lower cognitive load**, not increase it  
- Great tools feel *quiet*, not impressive  
- Emotion is data  
- Software should adapt to humans — not the other way around  

> *“The best AI doesn’t feel like AI.”*
